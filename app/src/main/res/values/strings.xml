        climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.
        Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy,
        in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds.
        Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.
